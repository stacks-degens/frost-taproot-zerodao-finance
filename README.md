# krustology

This is a reimplementation of some parts of Coinbase's
[kryptology](https://github.com/coinbase/kryptology) library, but in Rust.

This is not complete yet and **has not been audited in any way**.  It is also a
1:1 translation and currently has some carryover from Go paradigms that we will
eventually refactor out to be more rustic.

## Current goals

* FROST DKG
* FROST threshold signatures
